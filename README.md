### Architecture Decisions

**Component Strategy**: Each major section (Hero, Features, Services, Contact) exists as an independent component, enabling easy maintenance and feature updates without affecting other areas.

**State Management**: Leveraging React's built-in state management with hooks for form handling and UI interactions, avoiding unnecessary complexity from external state libraries.

**Performance Strategy**: Code splitting through dynamic imports, optimized image loading, and minimal bundle size through careful dependency selection.

**Scalability Approach**: Modular architecture supports easy addition of new languages, services, or features without requiring significant refactoring.
